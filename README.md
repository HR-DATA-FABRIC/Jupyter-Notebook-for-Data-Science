# Creating-AI-Data-Products-Using-Jupyter-Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful coding tool for interactively developing and presenting code.
This GitHub-repository will walk you through how to use Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects and how to set it up on your local machine.

To be more precice, Jupyter notebook is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener">cloud-based IDE</a> [Integrated Development Environment]. It is predominantly used to create Jupyter documents [.ipnyb] that can be created and shared with live codes. That is, it is a web-based interactive computational environment. The Jupyter notebook can support various languages that are popular in data science such as Python, Julia, Scala, R, etc.1

The goal is to set users on the path toward using the Python language by preparing them to write their 1rst script. This tutorial is divided in the following fashion: a small introduction to Python, how to download the Anaconda software, the different content that comes with the installation, and a simple example related to implementing a Python script.

Best of all, as part of the open source <a href="https://jupyter.org/" style="outline: none;">Project Jupyter</a>, Jupyter Notebooks are completely free []. You can download the software <a href="https://jupyter.org/install" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener">on its own</a>, or as part of the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anaconda data science toolkit</a>.
