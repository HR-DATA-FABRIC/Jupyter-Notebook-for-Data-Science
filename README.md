# Creating-AI-Data-Products-Using-Jupyter-Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting AI data product projects.
This GitHub-repository will walk you through how to use Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects and how to set it up on your local machine.

The goal is to set users on the path toward using the Python language by preparing them to write their 1rst script. This tutorial is divided in the following fashion: a small introduction to Python, how to download the Anaconda software, the different content that comes with the installation, and a simple example related to implementing a Python script.

Best of all, as part of the open source Project Jupyter, Jupyter Notebooks are completely free []. You can download the software on its own, or as part of the Anaconda data science toolkit.
