# Creating-AI-Data-Products-Using-Jupyter-Notebooks

<a href="https://jupyter.org/try" style="outline: none;">Jupyter</a> is an amazing &  versatile coding tool for interactively developing and presenting data science workflows in order to create data products. This GitHub-repository will walk you through "How to employ Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects". I start by explaining how to set it up on your local machine [DIY]. For a more critical review on Jupyter (Notebooks) see <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-case-against-the-jupyter-notebook-d4da17e97243" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener">The case against the jupyter notebook</a>. Nonetheless, Jupyter is currently the coding tool of choice among "data scientists" see for example:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener"> Nature 563, 145-146 (2018)</a> https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2021 https://www.anaconda.com/state-of-data-science-2021.
 

A Jupyter Notebook <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-09961-9"  target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener"> (Pimentel et al., 2021)</a>  is both an interactive literate programming document and an application that executes the document. Hence, notebooks are living documents, meaning they can be edited to respond to questions or input from students and used a conversation piece during a lecture or presentation.
 
To be more precise, Jupyter notebook is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener"> web-browser based IDE</a> [Integrated Development Environment]. Data Scientists use notebooks mainly to create documents that can be created and shared with live code. In other words, it represents a web-based interactive computational environment to perform research. Jupyter can support <a href="https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/jupyter.html" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener"> various programming languages (called “kernels” in the Jupyter ecosystem)</a> that are popular in data science such as Python, Java, R, Julia, Matlab, Octave, Scheme, Processing, Scala, and many more. 

The goal is to set users on the path toward using the Python language by preparing them to write their 1rst script. This tutorial is divided in the following fashion: a small introduction to Python, how to download the Anaconda software, the different content that comes with the installation, and a simple example related to implementing a Python script.

Best of all, as part of the open source <a href="https://jupyter.org/" style="outline: none;">Project Jupyter</a>, Jupyter Notebooks are completely free. You can download the software <a href="https://jupyter.org/install" target="_blank" style="outline: none;" rel="noopener">on its own</a>, or as part of the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anaconda data science toolkit</a>. 

In addition, Jupyter combined with <a href="https://mybinder.org/" style="outline: none;">Binder</a> allows the owner of a set of notebooks residing in a public repository to pre-build an image in the Binder service, and get a shareable link that any visitor can use to obtain a working instance of JupyterHub, pre-loaded with the notebooks in the repository. The session is temporary (any changes the user makes will be deleted when closing the tab or window), but it’s fully interactive. Binder can be used as a web-based service for running one-off workshops or tutorials. 

There are also very diffent ways in which to use Jupyter Notebooks:
